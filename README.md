# Business Analyst's Toolkit
<img src="https://github.com/robspuerta/Project4_BAToolkit/blob/main/Business%20Analyst's%20toolkit%20github%20banner.png"/> 

Every practice has its own set of tools, and Business Analysis (BA) is no exception. Having the right tool is key to successfully completing the task at hand by efficiently exploring, surveying, analyzing, understanding, sharing, and more! Here are some BA Tools I have learned:

## MS Teams & Outlook
I wanted to start with these because they are the most used tools on a daily basis. These are great for **communication, collaboration, and sharing files** with your team members (and anyone basically); and while working from anywhere in the world, stay on the same page with your team.

## Jira & Planner
I have used these two to **plan, track, and manage projects,** especially in [Agile Methodologies](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-methodology-language-robin-puerta/). Planner is an MS Office software for basic initiatives; it's simple and very intuitive. On the other hand, Jira is more complex, personalizable, and fully helps teams to keep track of epics and user stories.

## PlanningPokerOnline.com/
Here, you can create online **"Poker Planning"** sessions as Poker games, making them fun, transparent, and efficient. Poker planning (also called Scrum Poker) is a technique in [Agile Methodologies](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-methodology-language-robin-puerta/) to estimate relative user-stories size, effort, or time required to complete it.

## Miro & Mural
Great for Discoveries and Retrospectives, these **visual apps enable team collaboration in a creative environment**. They have many features, and luckily, many templates have been created for them, so you can have a great experience with a few twitches.

## MS Office: Timer
It is a very easy and simple **time management tool** to use on the status meeting when each participant has a set time to present their updates. It is also convenient when practicing for an *"Elevator Pitch"*.

## Survey Monkey & Google form
Great for **online surveys** to get insights on product and customer experiences. With a well-thought-out survey, you can get structured data for future data-decision making.

## Visio & Bizagi
Ideal for a **visual representation of processes**, considering activities, technologies, and people involved using diagrams. These are a must-know for **Business Analysts**. Currently, I use the BPMN model and am looking forward to learning more about UML diagrams.

## MS Excel (Pivot tables and VBA Macros)
The MS Office and Google solutions for **spreadsheets** are definitely another *must-have* for a **Business Analyst**. With a great data structure, you can create pivot tables. Also, automate reports using macros. I have made some of these macros to save time and energy on repetitive tasks and spend more time examining data to find data trends and patterns.

## <!--Power BI & -->Excel Dashboards
These are great for **data visualization and reports**. Power BI is a MS software that, in my opinion, mixes the data processing power of SQL and the easy-to-use characteristics of Excel. On the other hand, Excel is way more intuitive and ideal when your data has less than 10k events.

## Power Point & Prezi
Great for **presentations**; both had evolved a lot since their beginnings. I prefer MS PowerPoint but I can't be denied the visual impact of Prezi on meetings. Like Miro and Mural, these both have many templates available.

## Confluence
Great for **team collaborations**, often linked to Jira. In Confluence, you can store all your analysis and documentation. What I like the most is you can create templates to help you structure stories, making sure you are not forgetting anything.

Let me know in the comments what tools you are familiar with, or if you know more about these so I can check them out.
