# Business Analyst Toolkit (“You’re only as good as the tools you use”)
Every practice has its own set of tools and Business Analysis (BA) is no exception. Having the right tool is key to successfully complete the task at hand by effiently explore, survey, analyze, understand, share and more! Here are some BA Tools I have learn:

## MS Teams / Outlook
These are great for communications and collaborations and I wanted to start with them because these are the must used tools on daily basis. These are great for sharing files with your team members (and anyone basically) and helps you to stay work from anywhere in the world and, at the same time, be in the same page with your team, especially if you are working from home. 

## Jira / Planner
GIF / GIF
I have use these two to plan, track and manage projects specially in Agile Methodologies. Planner is a MS Office software for basic initiatives, it's simple and very intuitive. In the other hand, Jira is more complex, personalizable and fully help teams to keep track of epics and user stories.

## https://planningpokeronline.com/
Here you can create "Poker Planning" sessions as Poker games, making them fun, transparent and efficient. Poker planning (also called Scrum Poker) is a technique in Agile Methodology to estimate relative user-stories size, effort or time required to complete it. 

## Miro / Mural
Great for Discoveries and Retrospectives, these visual apps enable team collaboration in a creative enviroment. They have many features and luckly a lot of template had been created for them so you can have great experience with a few twitchs.

## MS Office: Timer
It is a very easy and simple time managment tool to use on status meeting, when each participant have a set period of time to present their updates. It is also convenient when practicing for a "Elevator Pitch".

## Survey Moneky / Google form

## Visio / Bizagi
visual representation of the processes, considering activities, technologies and people involved using diagrams. 
This is by far the most used tool in my meetings
BPMN

## Excel (pivot table / macros)
examing data to find data trends and patterns. great for small datasets (less than 10k events)
several features

## Power BI / Dashboards in Excel
These are great for data visualization and reports. Power BI es a MS software that mix the data processing power of SQL and the easy-to-use characteristics of Excel.


## PPT / Prezi

## Confluence
range of formats
collect all the data

Let me know in the comments what tools are you familiar with or if you know more out of these so I can check them out.
