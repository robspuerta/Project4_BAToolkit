# Business Analyst Toolkit (“You’re only as good as the tools you use”)
Every practice has its own set of tools and Business Analysis (BA) is no exception. Having the right tool is key to successfully complete the task at hand by effiently explore, survey, analyze, understand, share and more! Here are some BA Tools I have learn:

## MS Teams / Outlook
These are great for communications and collaborations and I wanted to start with them because these are the must used tools on daily basis. These are great for sharing files with your team members (and anyone basically) and helps you to stay work from anywhere in the world and, at the same time, be in the same page with your team, especially if you are working from home. 

## Jira / Planner

I have use these two to plan, track and manage projects specially in Agile Methodologies. Planner is a MS Office software for basic initiatives, it's simple and very intuitive. In the other hand, Jira is more complex, personalizable and fully help teams to keep track of epics and user stories.

Here you can create "Poker Planning" sessions as Poker games, making them fun, transparent and efficient. Poker planning (also called Scrum Poker) is a technique in Agile Methodology to estimate relative user-stories size, effort or time required to complete it. 

## Miro / Mural
Great for Discoveries and Retrospectives, these visual apps enable team collaboration in a creative enviroment. They have many features and luckly a lot of template had been created for them so you can have great experience with a few twitchs.

## MS Office: Timer
It is a very easy and simple time managment tool to use on status meeting, when each participant have a set period of time to present their updates. It is also convenient when practicing for a "Elevator Pitch".

## Survey Moneky / Google form
Great for online surveys to get insights on product and customer experiences. With a well thought survey you can get structured data for future data-decision making. 

## Visio / Bizagi
Ideal for visual representation of processes, considering activities, technologies and people involved using diagrams. These are a must know for Business Analyst. Currently I use BPMN model and looking forward to learn more about UML diagrams. 

## MS Excel (pivot table / macros)
The Ms Office and Google solution for spreadsheet is definetly another must have for a BA. With a great data structure you can create pivot tables. Also automate reports using macros. I have made some of these macros to save time and energy on repetitive tasks, and spend more time examiningg data to find data trends and patterns. 

## Power BI / Dashboards in Excel
These are great for data visualization and reports. In my opinion, Power BI is a MS software that mix the data processing power of SQL and the easy-to-use characteristics of Excel. On the other hand, Excel in my opinion is way more intuitive and ideal when your data has lees than 10k events.

## Power Point / Prezi
Great for presentations, both had evolved a lot since their beginings. I prefer MS Power Point but can't denied the visual impact that Prezi has on meetings. Like Miro and Mural, these both have many templates available.

## Confluence
Great for team collaborations, often linked to Jira. In here you can store all your anlysis and documantion. What I like the most is you can create templates to help you strcuture stories with the same data, making sure you are not forgetting anything. You cand check my post on Confluence for more detail.

Let me know in the comments what tools are you familiar with, or if you know more out of these so I can check them out.
